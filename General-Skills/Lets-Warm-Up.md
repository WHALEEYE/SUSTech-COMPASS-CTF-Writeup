# Lets Warm Up

### Description

If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?

##### Hint

> Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

### Writeup

将`0x70`对应的ASCII字符表示出来后用`picoCTF{}`包裹即是Flag。
