# Calculat3 M3

### Description

Here! http://web.ctflearn.com/web7/ I forget how we were doing those calculations, but something tells me it was pretty insecure.

### Writeup

Open the site and we can find it's a calculator program ran by a JS script.

Use Burp Suite we can find that the operators are sent by a POST request to the server in a parameter `expression`.

expression=9+*+9+
```

Check the JS script, we will find a code block like below:

```js
try 
{ 
  c(eval(document.getElementById("d").value)) 
} 
```

This is pretty insecure with function `eval()`. Use payload `expression=9;ls` to let the server execute the command `ls`, then we can get the flag.
